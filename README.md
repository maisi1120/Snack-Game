# Overview
This project is developed using Python, following OOP and using the `turtle` and `time` module. The goal is for snake to reach the worm and eat it.

# Instructions
Use the "arrow up," "arrow down," "arrow left," and "arrow right" keys to guide the snake towards the worm. The snake grows larger and earns one point with each successful consumption of the worm. The game resets if the snake collides with the wall. The highest score is displayed on the screen for future reference when users reopen the game.
